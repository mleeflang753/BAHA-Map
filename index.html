    The Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association (BAHA) is Berkeley’s non-profit preservation organization whose mission is to promote, through education, an understanding and appreciation for Berkeley’s history, and to encourage the preservation of its historic buildings. Incorporated on 9 December 1974, the organization has been active since 1971.

    <h1> Heritage Map of Berkeley</h1>

The first aspect of creating a web map was to make a custom basemap. I used Mapbox for this task, where I used the standard (non-satellite) imagery along with a faded color theme and daytime light preset. I thought the faded colors looked better than harsher and opaque colors, which gave the basemap a more realistic appearance rather than leaning into digital. The daytime preset gave the map a neutral color scheme, which the viewer would not even notice was a preset. I could have chosen nighttime or evening, but I felt that the viewer might notice this and wonder why. I also had the choice to use satellite imagery, but for a map where the user is viewing point data, using the standard background instead makes it easier to see them. Also, satellite imagery is an amalgamation of colors, so why use this when I am trying to show data that has nothing to do with the landscapes? I just want to show the streets and building shapes of Berkeley, so the standard imagery is what I went with. It was tempting to go all out with the many features Mapbox offered, but I wanted to give my basemap a dignified and scholarly appearance, much akin to a map you would find in a history book. In this way, I went with the Alegreya SC font. All labels were in black and boundaries were in red, as was default, but I changed all roads to a grey color so there were not that many clashing colors. The question of what roads are highways and what roads are small streets was not important to this topic. The last aspect I
changed for my basemap was the greenspace and water colors. I did not stray too far from the default green and blue, though I tried to make the land more yellow-green and the oceans a deeper blue. I did not have any problems with setting up a custom basemap on Mapbox, and found all the options interesting on how they could be applied to other maps, such as the precipitation modes for example.
<br></br>
The next step dealt with coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, where I would input my BAHA points and attributes onto the basemap that was nested in my website. I played around with the icons, making them 10 points bigger so they were easier to see, and changed their outlines from white to black. There were only ten and I changed the zoom value to fit them all when the map was loaded, so I could make them as big as I wanted without clutter. I tried different colors for the symbols, even trying to change them to triangles as a test, but found that the default blue was the color that stood out the most from the basemap. In the end, I was successful at creating the foundations of the web map, except for one problem that myself and others in my lab struggled with. When coding the popups, they would appear as a block of text below the map when an icon was clicked. The popups were instead supposed to be square bubbles next to the icons, and after checking the code numerous times, I could not figure out why this error was occurring. Did I format my page wrong with conflicting brackets and semicolons? Did I mistype something? What actually happened was that I forgot to add a single line of code in the HTML, which was a stylesheet that linked the mapbox data to CSS. My only other struggle was that I am new to web design, and do not have a wide bank of knowledge and codes to pull from.
At this point, my website was just a map taking up the entire page. This completed the task of showing the viewer ten architectural heritage sites in Berkeley, but I wanted to add a title, along with
my name, date, and a source. I also added a couple sentences describing the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association, as found on their website that I left as a link. I did not know how to do this beforehand, and I looked up a tutorial on W3Schools on hyperlinks. I also wanted to add an image, which I learned how to align to center with CSS. I also found CSS code on Stack Overflow on how to add a border around the page. I lastly played around with the sizing and borders for my text and map, making sure that the “Heritage Map of Berkeley” label was as far down as the upper left corner of the map, and making sure that the map itself was perfectly aligned within the black borders I added. This is all I wanted for this website, and I think it does a good job of telling you what you are looking at as well as providing an interactive web map.
